# vite-pages library starter

This is a demo project for [vite-plugin-react-pages](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages).
This project demonstrate how to develop a library using vite as your local develop environment.

Notice that we put the **whole** vite-pages project (including config, index.html, .etc) into a sub folder. It makes the root directory cleaner. **This is a neet way to "embed" a vite-pages document project inside your main project.**
