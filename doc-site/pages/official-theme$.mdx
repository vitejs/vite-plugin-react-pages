# Official Theme

`vite-pages-theme-doc` is an official theme of vite-pages. It should satisfy most users' needs. This document site is powered by this theme.

## How to use

You should config the theme in `_theme.tsx`:

```tsx
// _theme.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { createTheme } from 'vite-pages-theme-doc'

export default createTheme({
  topNavs: [
    { label: 'index', path: '/' },
    { label: 'Vite', href: 'https://github.com/vitejs/vite' },
  ],
  logo: 'Vite Pages',
  // Other configs...
})
```

[Here is a complete example](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/tree/main/packages/playground/use-theme-doc).

## Auto side menu generation

Doc theme can generation a side menu automatically, based on the pages information.

You can control the title/sorting/grouping of the side menu, by notating these [page static data](/page-data#static-data):

- title
- order (default order is 1)
- group (explain later)
- subGroup (explain later)

### How side menu generation works

For example, if your site has these pages:

```
/
/playground
/components
/components/button
/components/card
/references/glossary
/references/apis/api1
/references/apis/api2
/references/error-codes/code1
/references/error-codes/code2
```

Firstly, the theme will divide pages into `group`s based on the **first segment** of page path:

```
group /:
  /
  /playground

group components:
  /components
  /components/button
  /components/card

group references:
  /references/glossary
  /references/apis/api1
  /references/apis/api2
  /references/error-codes/code1
  /references/error-codes/code2
```

You can customize `group` in page static data. For example:

```
Put this at top of a markdown page:
---
group: references
---
Or put this at top of a tsx/jsx page:
/**
 * @group references
 */
```

Then, the theme will divide pages into `subGroup`s based on the **second segment** of pages' path:

```
group /:
  subGroup /:
    /
    /playground

group components:
  subGroup /:
    /components
    /components/button
    /components/card

group references:
  subGroup /:
    /references/glossary
  subGroup apis:
    /references/apis/api1
    /references/apis/api2
  subGroup error-codes:
    /references/error-codes/code1
    /references/error-codes/code2
```

`subGroup` can also be customized in page static data, just like `group` does.

What is the meanings of `group` and `subGroup`?

- `group` is a site isolation boundary: we only display **one** `group` at a time. If a user open a page in group `references`, he/she will **only see side menu items from that group**. He/She will not see menu items from `components` group.
- `subGroup` decide how the theme sort side menu items. All side menu items with same `subGroup` will be rendered adjacently. This document site is an example.

## Theme configs

The `createTheme` exported by `vite-pages-theme-doc` accepts [these options](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/main/packages/theme-doc/src/index.tsx):

<FileText src="../../packages/theme-doc/src/ThemeConfig.type.ts" syntax="ts" />

## Fully theme customization

If the basic theme doesn't satisfy your need, you can [create your own theme](/theme-customization).
