# Filesystem Routing

Vite-pages generates page routes based on your project file structure (filesystem routing).

## Basic Filesystem Routing Convention

The basic filesystem routing convention is very intuitive. It works out of the box and doesn't need any config. It should satisfy most users' needs.

**You can create a page by simply creating a file**: `page-name$.tsx`. Notice the `$` **at the end of the filename**. Vite-pages recognizes it and know it is a page entry.

If the filename is `index$.tsx`, the page route path will be the path of the directory. See examples below.

> All file extensions `.ts|.tsx|.js|.jsx|.md|.mdx` works, as long as `$` is the last character before the extension.

## Examples

| file path                                   | page url path          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `index$.tsx`                                | `/`                    |
| `$.tsx` (has same effect as `index$.tsx`)   | `/`                    |
| `page-one$.tsx`                             | `/page-one`            |
| `page-two$.md`                              | `/page-two`            |
| `dir-name/index$.jsx`                       | `/dir-name`            |
| `dir-name/page-three$.mdx`                  | `/dir-name/page-three` |
| `dir-name/[id]/index$.tsx` (URL Paramater)  | `/dir-name/:id`        |
| `dir-name/[id]/[id2]$.tsx` (URL Paramaters) | `/dir-name/:id/:id2`   |

Theme can decide what to render when no page matches the url. Checkout <Link to="/theme">the theme doc</Link>.

If a page path contains url paramaters, you can use [useParams](https://reactrouter.com/web/example/url-params) of `react-router-dom` to access the actual paramaters.

Checkout [the basic fixture](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/master/fixtures/basic/pages) for an example.

## Advanced Filesystem Routing

The "Basic Filesystem Routing Convention" should satisfy most users' needs. For advanced users, vite-pages let you implement your own filesystem routing convention: you can **teach vite-pages how to collect pages from your project**.
