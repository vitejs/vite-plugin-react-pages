# Theme customization

> This is an advance guide about how to make a theme by yourself. If there is already themes that meet your needs(.e.g <Link to="/basic-theme">the basic theme</Link>), you don't need to read this guide now!

Vite-pages itself doesn't render any concrete DOM node. Users can customize **anything** on the page with theme. That's why theme is so powerful.

To use a theme, users should export their theme from `_theme.tsx`. It should export a React compoent. It will be rendered by vite-pages core, and get useful info from props:

- All pages' static data
- All runtime data that is already loaded
- The current loading state of the app

Here is the interface of a theme:

import ThemeInterface from './theme-interface.mdx'

<ThemeInterface />

You can learn more about the "data" received by the render functions in <Link to="/page-data">the page data doc</Link>.

This is probably [the simplest theme](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/master/fixtures/basic/pages/_theme.tsx):

```tsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react'
import type { Theme } from 'vite-plugin-react-pages'

const Theme: Theme = ({ staticData, loadedData, loadState }) => {
  console.log('#Theme', staticData, loadedData, loadState)

  // You can generate side nav menu from staticData
  // const sideMenuData = useMemo(() => generateSideMenu(staticData), [staticData])

  if (loadState.type === '404') return <p>Page not found.</p>
  if (loadState.type === 'load-error') return <p>Load error!</p>
  if (loadState.type === 'loading') return <p>Loading...</p>

  // loadState.type === 'loaded'
  // Runtime page data for current page
  const pageData = loadedData[loadState.routePath]
  // the default export of the main module
  const Component = pageData.main.default
  return <Component />
}

export default Theme
```

> Here is a more useful theme: [vite-pages-theme-basic](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/master/packages/theme-basic/src/index.tsx). [This fixture](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/master/fixtures/use-theme/pages/_theme.tsx) demonstrate how to use it.

You can customize every bits of UI with theme. Welcome to share your theme with a npm package!

## Suggestions

### To theme providers: make your theme easier to use

We encourage theme providers to export your theme as **a config function** that receive user config and return a `Theme`.

For example, the theme provider can export theme like this:

```tsx
// The theme config function accepts navs config
export default function createTheme({ navs }: Option = {}): Theme {
  return ({ loadedData, loadState }) => {
    if (loadState.type !== 'loaded')
      return (
        <Layout navs={navs}>
          <p>Loading...</p>
        </Layout>
      )
    // Runtime page data for current page
    const pageData = loadedData[loadState.routePath]
    // the default export of the main module
    const Component = pageData.main.default
    return (
      <Layout navs={navs}>
        <Component />
      </Layout>
    )
  }
}
```

Theme consumers can use it to config their navs menu:

```tsx
// Theme users can configure sideMenu in `/_theme.tsx`:
import createTheme from 'theme-pkg'
export default createTheme({
  navs: [
    { path: '/guides/guide1', label: 'guide1' },
    { path: '/guides/guide2', label: 'guide1' },
  ],
})
```

As you can see, the theme is easier to use because **theme consumers don't need to know about the `Theme` API from vite-pages**. They only need to know about `createTheme` API from the theme. Users should be talking to the theme, instead of talking directly to vite-pages framework.

For this reason, we encourage theme providers to export config function like the `createTheme` above.

#### Releases the power of Typescript

The above example show another benefit for users: theme users can get Typescript type-check and intelliSense when they are writing theme config. This is because users are calling the theme config function, instead of "exporting some configs".

## Share your theme!

It is easy to write a theme that is sharable and configurable.

If you have design and implement a theme(.e.g a blog theme, a document site theme), welcome to share your theme with a npm package, or contribute it to [the vite-pages repo](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/tree/master/packages)!
